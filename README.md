### Key Concepts and Changes

1. **Simplified Path Management**  
   Previously, the paths for result and read files were set within internal packages. To streamline this, we have moved these paths to the `main` function. This ensures better visibility and management of file paths at the entry point of the application.

2. **Introducing the `FileManager` Struct**  
   To improve code organization, we created a custom struct named `FileManager` in the `filemanager` package. This struct now holds the input and output file paths, making the implementation cleaner and more structured.

3. **Integration with `prices.go`**  
   The `FileManager` struct is now passed as a parameter to functions in the `prices.go` file. This enables a modular and consistent way to manage file operations across the codebase.

4. **Swappable Structs and Methods**  
   To enable flexibility and extensibility, we introduced the concept of swappable structs and their methods. This approach allows for easy replacement or addition of structs with different functionalities as needed.

5. **Using Interfaces for Flexibility**  
   In Go, interfaces are a powerful feature for achieving flexibility and reusability. We defined interfaces that list the required methods with their input parameters and return types. Go automatically identifies structs that implement these methods and treats them as satisfying the interface.  

   For instance, if a user struct (`A`) wants to use methods from two structs (`B` and `C`), you can:
   - Define an interface listing the required methods with their expected inputs and outputs.
   - Implement these methods in `B` and `C`.
   - Use the interface type to refer to `B` and `C`, enabling dynamic selection of struct and method combinations.

### Example Explanation (Point A)

Letâ€™s consider a user struct (`A`) that wants to use methods from two other structs (`B` and `C`).  

Go provides a seamless way to achieve this:  
- Define an interface that lists the required methods with their input parameters and return values.  
- Ensure that `B` and `C` implement these methods.  
- Use the interface type as a reference for `A` to access the desired methods.  

Go will automatically recognize `B` and `C` as implementations of the interface and allow them to be used interchangeably.  

This approach provides flexibility to incorporate different types of structs and methods (e.g., `B` and `C`) into the same user struct (`A`), depending on the requirements.
